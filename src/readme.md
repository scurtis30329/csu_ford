# **Steps to recreate the output**

1)Copy all .csv raw data files into your SAS University>myfolder subdirectory, so that they can be picked up by your virtual environment

2)Open up SAS Studio

3)Import your raw data according the code used below:
  
**file:15_18_QR_scurtis_sa.csv**
  
  code:student_achievement_descriptive
  
  output:desc_output_sa.pdf
  
  description: descriptive statistics for student achievement
  
  
  
  **file:15_18_QR_scurtis_ct.csv**
  
  code:collab_teach_descriptive
  
  output:desc_output_ct.pdf
  
  description: descriptive statistics for collaborative teaching
  
  
  
  **file:15_18_QR_scurtis_sa_frq.csv**
  
  code:student_achievement_corr
  
  output:corr_sa.pdf
  
  description: correlation statistics for student achievement
  
  
  
  **file:15_18_QR_scurtis_ct_frq.csv**
  
  code:collab_teach_corr
  
  output:corr_ct.pdf
  
  description: correlation statistics for collaborative teaching
  
  4)You may need to modify the work import name, depending on how many files are open, but once you copy in the code, it is ready to be processed.  If you choose not the use the code, other tools templates are available under Task and Utilities .

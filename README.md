### SAS Installation Instructions

SAS University Edition Instruction Sheet:

Select your operating system
Your directions will differ depending on your operating system – it is basically four steps.

The first step is to download the virtualization software and install it. Again, the options and
instructions will vary on the operating system.

The next window will tell you how to download your virtual software and setup the file folders you will need
to communicate with SAS and move files back and forth between the virtual environment. So you are performing two things here, you are getting your virtualization software and you are creating a local folder to house your SAS files

Next download your version of the SAS University Edition. This is a large download so make sure you
are on reliable Internet service. Click on the Get SAS University Edition box to download. You will be
asked to create a SAS Profile if you do not have one. Make sure to use your CSU-Global email address
and note your user name and password for future use. Make sure you note where your download this
file.

Then you will need to add the SAS download – that is why you needed to know where you downloaded
it. You will also configure SAS to see that shared folder you created in the early steps. Remember this
folder will be one that SAS can see and your operating system can see – you will use it to pass information back and
forth to your SAS program.
